# Interactive 3D Portfolio Experience

A React-based web application showcasing interactive 3D graphics using Three.js. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies with real-time 3D rendering to create an engaging user interface.

## Project Status & Scope

**⚠️ Note: This is a technical proof-of-concept**

This project is intentionally focused on demonstrating technical capabilities in browser-based 3D graphics rather than presenting a polished, production-ready application. Specifically, it showcases:

- Implementation of custom Three.js scenes and components
- Real-time 3D rendering with particle systems
- Basic GLSL shader programming
- Integration of 3D graphics with React
- Performance optimization techniques for complex 3D scenes

The current styling, UI/UX, and overall polish are intentionally minimal, as the primary goal is to demonstrate the technical implementation of browser-based 3D graphics created purely through code, without relying on pre-built 3D models or external 3D modeling software.

### Future Improvements
- Enhanced UI/UX design
- Responsive design optimization
- Additional interactive features
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Accessibility improvements

_This project serves as a technical demonstration and starting point for more refined implementations._
