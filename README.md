# Interactive 3D Portfolio Experience

A React-based web application showcasing interactive 3D graphics using Three.js. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies with real-time 3D rendering to create an engaging user interface.

## Key Features

### 3D Visualization
- Interactive Earth model with day/night cycle visualization
- Dynamic particle system with 8,000+ particles using instanced rendering
- Custom glass-like panels with hover effects and dynamic lighting
- Smooth orbital camera controls for immersive navigation

### Technical Implementation
- Built with React 18 and Three.js
- React Three Fiber for declarative 3D scene management
- Basic GLSL shader implementation for Earth day/night cycle
- Efficient particle rendering using instanced meshes
- State management with Zustand

### Performance Features
- Optimized particle system using instanced geometry
- Efficient render management with useFrame and useMemo
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive 3D rendering

## Technical Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Three.js / React Three Fiber
- @react-three/drei for 3D utilities
- @react-three/postprocessing for visual effects

## Development Highlights
- Custom implementation of floating panel system
- Interactive particle systems with orbital and field effects
- Basic shader programming for Earth visualization
- Responsive 3D scene management
- Integration of 2D UI elements in 3D space

This project serves as a demonstration of 3D web graphics capabilities using React and Three.js, showcasing practical implementation of real-time 3D rendering in a web browser.
