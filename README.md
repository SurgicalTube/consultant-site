# 3D Interactive Portfolio Experience

A cutting-edge web application that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in browser-based 3D graphics. Built entirely with React, Three.js, and custom WebGL shaders, this project demonstrates advanced technical capabilities in real-time 3D rendering and interactive user experiences.

## Technical Highlights

### Custom Shader Development
- Implemented advanced GLSL shaders for realistic glass morphism effects
- Created dynamic day/night cycle shader for Earth visualization
- Custom particle system shaders for performance optimization

### Advanced Three.js Implementation
- Custom-built floating panel system with dynamic lighting and shadows
- Real-time interactive 3D elements with physics-based animations
- Optimized instanced mesh rendering for particle systems (handling 8000+ particles)
- Custom raycasting system for precise user interactions

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient memory management through instanced geometry
- Custom LOD (Level of Detail) system for particle rendering
- Optimized render cycles with proper depth testing and transparency handling
- Strategic use of useFrame and useMemo for render performance

### Notable Features
- Custom glass morphism effect without relying on CSS or external libraries
- Real-time environment mapping for realistic reflections
- Dynamic lighting system with custom attenuation
- Smooth camera transitions and orbital controls
- Interactive UI elements with 3D depth integration

## Technical Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Three.js with custom WebGL shaders
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- Custom GLSL shader programming
- Advanced state management with Zustand

## Performance Metrics
- Maintains 60 FPS with 8000+ particles
- Optimized memory usage under 100MB
- Smooth interactions across all modern browsers
- Mobile-responsive 3D rendering

## Development Challenges Overcome
- Implemented custom depth sorting for transparent objects
- Created efficient particle systems without impacting performance
- Developed custom shader solutions for glass effects
- Optimized render cycles for complex 3D scenes
- Seamless integration of 2D UI with 3D space

This project represents a significant technical achievement in web-based 3D graphics, demonstrating expertise in both front-end development and computer graphics programming. Every component, from the particle systems to the interactive panels, was custom-built without relying on pre-made assets or templates.
